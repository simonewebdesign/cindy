# Cindy

Cindy is a command-line syndication tool. It checks an RSS feed for new entries and sends a bunch of emails on behalf of an email address of your choice.

The recipients are validated before an email is sent, according to a regular expression you can specify. Failures are noted at the end of the process, so you can decide what to do next (i.e. maybe retry sending, or delete the bogus address from your mailing list).

The template is simple HTML and can be fully customized in any way you like.

If you're a blogger, you can see Cindy as a replacement for a service like Mailchimp, but without all the complexity. At its core, Cindy takes the most recent RSS item and sends it out as a newsletter to your subscribers.
